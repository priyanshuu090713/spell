### rules
as this is a prototype , and a very beginer project , these are some rules :

+ all the code should be either  in the `code` directory or path should be defined
+ the code should start with `#startfile` and should end with `#endfile` ; evrything above and below will be comment blocks
+ `$$` is comment
+ syntax is defined in `cmddict.toml`

this is still an improving project and as of now is a prototype
